# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug related to MongoDB aggregation pipelines and date range queries. The provided JavaScript code snippet attempts to aggregate transactions within a specific date range and group them by userId to calculate the total amount for each user. However, due to an issue with date handling or a missing index, the aggregation pipeline fails to return the expected results.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline is designed to match transactions for a specific userId within a given date range and group those transactions to sum the amounts. However, the query returns an empty array or inaccurate results. This may be due to incorrect date formatting, timezone issues, or a missing index on the date field, leading to performance problems and incorrect output. 

## Bug Solution
The solution involves ensuring correct date formatting and timezone handling within the query. Additionally, creating a suitable index on the date and userId fields can significantly improve query performance and correctness. Please refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected implementation and detailed explanation.
